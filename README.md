# MassShootings

As a former student in the US, mass shootings were a concern of mine. 

I obtained a dataset from American journalist organization Mother Jones which covered mass shootings that took place between 1982-2022.

I constructed a dashboard depicting stats and trends of US Mass Shootings to get a more quantitive understanding of their nature.

May the victims rest in peace.
